GROWS 

Trying To Simulate A Very Small Environment 
https://github.com/akariumfish/grows/

Using Processing 3.5.4  -  https://www.processing.org/
Library : The MidiBus 8 Severin Smith http://smallbutdigital.com/projects/themidibus/

see previews for sample results
last relatively stable : grows2.9.5.exe in bin/grows2.9.5		( full screen )
in image/ there is screenshots of the developement of this phase

IF YOU JUST WANT TO TRY AND KNOW NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS (or you'r lazy) just send a mail to growsDev@gmail.com with subject "exe please" and i will mail the last stable executable to you.

If someone can help me setup a better solution for standard user download, it would be very appreciated.

-Quick lauch : 
--download :
-go to https://github.com/akariumfish/grows/tree/main/old for "stable" sources
-select a folder containning .pde files
        OR
-go to https://github.com/akariumfish/grows/tree/main/bin for the last executable
-select a folder
       then
-click on the three dots top right then copy path
-go to https://download-directory.github.io/
-paste then download
--or simply download the whole thing (simplest way, around 320Mb at ver2.9)
-go to https://github.com/akariumfish/grows/
-click the green button top right "<> code" then download ZIP

-once downloaded :
--executable (.exe) : bin/
        OR
--run the code directly
-go to https://processing.org/releases 
-download and install Processing Version 3.5.4 (January 17, 2020) windows 64b (or 32)
-get a folder containning .pde in /old
-double click on any .pde files
-once processing is launched click on the play button top left

-you can go to https://github.com/akariumfish/Grows_Old_Bin for old executable

Please be aware that im not a pro and its certainly not done efficiently, 
IN CASE OF FREEZING (or simply to exit) : left click anywhere then hit ESC

thanks for trying, no doc yet, good luck ... 	( sorry )
